[GLOBAL STYLE]
A hyperrealistic, cinematic 4-panel comic strip rendered in the style of advanced AI portrait photography.
Each panel must look like a high-quality, natural photograph — realistic human skin, lifelike eyes, and soft cinematic lighting.
Characters must remain the SAME person across all four panels — identical face, hairstyle, outfit, and overall appearance.
Do not introduce new characters or alter facial features, proportions, or clothing between panels.
Expressions, camera angles, and lighting can vary naturally, but the identity and setting must stay consistent.
Lighting should be realistic and artistic — warm morning light, soft reflections, or cinematic indoor tones.
Backgrounds must appear natural and photographic, such as cafes, apartments, or city streets.
The atmosphere should feel emotional and immersive, as if each frame were a still from a short film.
Use English text only if needed for narrative clarity (brief caption or subtitle), and keep it minimal and subtle.

[LAYOUT]
A realistic cinematic comic strip with EXACTLY four panels arranged in a perfect 2x2 grid layout.
There must be only four panels — two on the top row and two on the bottom row.
Each panel must be equal in size and shape, separated by clear white gutters with thin black borders.
Do NOT add any extra panels, frames, film borders, or decorative elements.
The overall image must clearly display a clean, balanced 2x2 structure — no 3x2, 1x6, 3x3, collage, or storyboard layouts.
Each panel should represent a single cinematic moment in sequence (Panel 1 → 4) of the same person.
