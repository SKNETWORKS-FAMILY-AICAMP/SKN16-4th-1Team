[GLOBAL STYLE]
A monochrome, intentionally poorly-drawn comic strip in the style of a cheap newspaper doodle.
Drawings must look clumsy, funny, and naive, with uneven black ink lines and very simple shapes.
No color — only black lines on a pure white background.
No shading, no gradients, no textures, and no digital effects of any kind.
The line quality should remain consistently rough across all panels.
Characters must appear to be the SAME person throughout all four panels — same face, hairstyle, outfit, and proportions.
Expressions and poses can vary, but the identity and outfit must remain identical.
The overall tone is lighthearted, simple, and comedic.
Short English captions or sound effects may appear, drawn by hand in a rough doodle style.
Do NOT include any Korean, symbols, or printed fonts — English text only.

[LAYOUT]
A comic strip with EXACTLY four panels arranged in a perfect 2x2 grid.
ONLY four panels: two on the top row and two on the bottom row.
Each panel must be equal in size, separated by clean white gutters, and outlined by thin black borders.
The overall image must visually show a clean 2x2 structure — no extra rows, no extra columns, no film bars, no collage, no storyboard.
Each panel represents a simple sequential moment (Panel 1 → 4) featuring the same character.

[NEGATIVE PROMPT]
no color, no realistic rendering, no digital painting, no photo style,
no shading, no gradient, no detailed background, no high detail,
no 6-panel, no 5-panel, no 3x3 layout, no 3x2 layout, no 1x6 layout, no storyboard, no collage,
no new characters, no different person in each panel, no outfit change, no hair color change,
no Korean text, no non-English text, no printed fonts, no 3D render, no title, no subtitles,
no inconsistent props, no multiple main characters, no realistic face rendering.
