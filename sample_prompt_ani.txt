[GLOBAL STYLE]
A colorful, expressive anime-style 4-panel comic strip inspired by modern Japanese animation.
Each panel must look like a clean digital anime scene — bright colors, sharp outlines, and soft painterly shading.
The SAME main character must appear consistently in all four panels with the same face, hairstyle, and outfit.
Do not introduce new characters or change the main character’s appearance between panels.
Expressions, poses, and camera angles can vary naturally, but the identity and clothing must stay consistent.
Backgrounds should be soft and atmospheric, showing everyday slice-of-life settings such as homes, schools, parks, or city streets.
Lighting should be warm and ambient — afternoon sunlight, glowing indoor tones, or pastel evening light.
The tone should be cheerful, story-driven, and emotionally engaging, like moments from a heartwarming anime episode.
Minimal English captions may appear for storytelling clarity; keep them subtle and handwritten in style.
No Korean text or printed fonts of any kind.

[LAYOUT]
A comic strip with EXACTLY four panels arranged in a perfect 2x2 grid layout.
Only four panels — two on the top row and two on the bottom row.
Each panel must be equal in size and shape, clearly separated by white gutters, and outlined by thin black borders.
The overall image must visibly show a clean 2x2 grid — no extra panels, no rows, no collage, no storyboard layout.
Each panel should represent a continuous sequence (Panel 1 → 4) featuring the same character.
